Today, in a glorious summer day, Anja’s memorial mosaic was finally unveiled just outside the Community Centre.

To put the mosaic into context, a small plaque with some of the children’s writings about the time spent with Anja will be added soon, as well as more smaller pieces of mosaic, watch this space.

A special thanks goes to Asa, Martin and Jay for helping out.

Feel free to visit the centre and admire first-hand the craftship of our volunteers.

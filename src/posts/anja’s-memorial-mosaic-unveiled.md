Today, in a glorious summer day, Anja’s memorial mosaic was finally unveiled just outside the Community Centre.

Here are some pictures showing our volunteers applying the final touches.

To put the mosaic into context, a small plaque with some of the children’s writings about the time spent with Anja will be added soon, as well as more smaller pieces of mosaic, watch this space.

A special thanks goes to Asa, Martin and Jay for helping out.

Feel free to visit the centre and admire first-hand the craftship of our volunteers.

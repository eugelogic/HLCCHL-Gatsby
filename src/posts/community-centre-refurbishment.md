We’ve had a makeover! The centre had been looking a little tired lately, but fortunately we were able to obtain a grant to refurbish the kitchen, as well as reorganise and refurbish the main space. We now have a beautiful new kitchen, and a refreshed main room with a wholly separate space for computing and small meetings, as well as some much needed storage.

There are a couple more bits to finish, such as the windows and we’re waiting on some new furnishings, but it is all coming along. We’re really pleased and think you will be too!

If you have moment, stop by and help us celebrate on Saturday, May 7th (3-5 pm), and/or attend another activity!

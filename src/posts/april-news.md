Dear HL residents,

The Community Centre, now officially a Tenants and Residents Association hall, is thriving!

Our [Monday lunch club](/monday-lunch/) continues to be very popular – and why not, when you can get a freshly cooked meal, tea or coffee and good company all for £3.00! There is usually delicious bakery to take away too, as [Gail’s](https://gailsbread.co.uk/bakeries/swains-lane/) and [Tesco](https://www.tesco.com/store-locator/uk/?bID=3477) kindly provide us with lovely stuff each week. If you like games, there are board games and cards available to use before or after lunch. In the autumn, we will be starting a second lunch club on a Friday, so [watch out for the start date](/whats-on/). There are no restrictions – anyone can come along from midday to around 1.30pm.

There is a painting class on a Tuesday from 12.30 – again, anyone can come, and there are special rates if you are over 75. Thursday is yoga day, and you can choose an afternoon or evening class, and the Zumba class has really taken off on Friday mornings! [All our events are shown on our noticeboard](/whats-on/) with contact details for these and other events, or you can enquire via [email at hollylodgelondon@hotmail.com](mailto:hollylodgelondon@hotmail.com).

We do not hire out the hall for parties any more, but [events such as classes, meetings or workshops are considered](/hall-hire/) if the hall is available.

Finally, if you have any spare time on Sunday April 8th, do pop into the centre up to 4pm to see the huge variety of beads and jewellery for sale – Mr Bead is visiting again!

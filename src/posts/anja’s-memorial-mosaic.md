During the last bank holiday weekend, members of the local community came together at the centre to work on Anja’s memorial mosaic.

[Take a look at the pictures in the gallery](/gallery) that illustrate how the mosaic was created.

Anja played a vital part in the running and support of the centre, the mosaic is a small token of appreciation for all she did as she’s deeply missed.

The mosaic will be displayed outside the centre in the next few days.
